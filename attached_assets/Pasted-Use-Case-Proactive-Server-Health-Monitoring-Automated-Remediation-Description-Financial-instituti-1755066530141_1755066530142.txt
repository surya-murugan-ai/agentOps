Use Case: Proactive Server Health Monitoring & Automated Remediation
Description
Financial institutions, insurance companies, and trading firms operate thousands of mission-critical servers. These generate high-volume telemetry data such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, process status, and network performance.
By leveraging AI-powered analytics, anomaly detection, historical trend analysis, and predictive modelling, telemetry is ingested, cleansed, and stored in a data lake.
The system forecasts potential performance degradations before they occur, recommends corrective actions, and autonomously executes pre-approved interventions—reducing downtime risk and improving operational efficiency.

Data Sources
Primary:

Server Telemetry

CPU usage (% utilization over time)

Memory utilization (used / available / %)

Disk space utilization & I/O performance

Process information (running, orphaned, stale)

Network performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rate)

System events, error logs, alerts

Secondary (Optional Triggers):

IT Operations Team (receives alerts, approves automated actions)

Business Application Owners (stakeholders of impacted applications)

Main Flow
1. Data Ingestion & Cleansing
Collect real-time telemetry from all servers.

Normalize data formats, handle missing values, and remove duplicates.

Apply preprocessing for noise reduction.

2. Data Storage & Access
Store cleansed telemetry in a scalable data lake (e.g., S3, Azure Data Lake).

Maintain historical datasets for trend and seasonal pattern analysis.

Enable API access for analytics and dashboards.

3. Real-Time Analysis
Apply anomaly detection (statistical + ML-based) to flag unusual CPU, memory, disk, or process behaviour.

Compare against historical baselines and dynamic thresholds.

Tag incidents by severity and potential impact.

4. Prediction & Impact Assessment
Use predictive models to forecast potential failures or performance degradation.

Simulate potential business impacts (transaction delays, outages).

Prioritize alerts based on urgency and business criticality.

5. Recommendation Generation
Suggest targeted corrective actions:

Process restarts

Memory cleanup

Disk space expansion

CPU scheduling optimization

Include confidence score, urgency, and expected downtime prevention metrics.

6. Automated Remediation
Execute pre-approved actions without human intervention:

Restart unresponsive or orphaned processes.

Free or reallocate memory.

Mount additional disk storage.

Optimize CPU scheduling.

Clear temporary/log files.

Audit logging of all automated actions for compliance.

Agentic Automation Architecture
Agents:

Telemetry Collector Agent – gathers and cleans server data.

Anomaly Detection Agent – flags abnormal behaviour in real-time.

Predictive Analytics Agent – forecasts potential issues.

Recommendation Agent – generates remediation suggestions.

Approval & Compliance Agent – routes high-risk fixes for manual approval.

Remediation Executor Agent – performs pre-approved fixes.

Audit & Reporting Agent – logs and generates compliance reports.

Key Benefits
Proactive Prevention: Catch issues before downtime.

Reduced MTTR: Automated fixes shorten recovery time.

Operational Efficiency: Fewer manual interventions.

Compliance & Audit Ready: Detailed logs for regulatory needs.

Business Continuity: Minimizes disruption for end users.
