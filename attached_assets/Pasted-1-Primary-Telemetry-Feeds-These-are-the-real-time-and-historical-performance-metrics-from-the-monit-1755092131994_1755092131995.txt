1. Primary Telemetry Feeds
These are the real-time and historical performance metrics from the monitored servers.
Source: OS agents, server monitoring tools (Prometheus, Datadog, Splunk, Elastic, Nagios, etc.)

Input	Description	Example Granularity
CPU Usage (%)	Percentage utilization per core or aggregate.	60s interval, per host
Memory Utilization	Used, available, percentage usage.	60s interval, per host
Disk Space Utilization	Percentage full, available GB.	60s interval, per mount point
Disk I/O Performance	Read/write IOPS, latency.	60s interval
Process Information	Running processes, orphaned/stale processes, zombie processes.	On change or 5 min
Network Metrics	Throughput, error rates, packet drops, latency.	60s interval
System Events & Logs	OS/system errors, warnings, alerts.	Event-driven
Application Performance Metrics (optional)	p95 latency, error rates for services.	1–5 min
Service Availability	Uptime/heartbeat checks.	30–60s

2. Reference / Metadata Inputs
These give business and operational context to telemetry data.

Input	Description	Example
Host Inventory (dim_host)	Mapping of host IDs to environment (prod/staging/dev), service/application, region, owner.	host123 → prod, trading-core, APAC
SLO/SLAs	Target thresholds for metrics per service (e.g., CPU ≤ 80%, p95 latency ≤ 200ms).	latency_slo = 200ms
Remediation Playbook	Pre-approved corrective actions for given anomaly types, with rules.	CPU high → optimize scheduler
Approval Policies	Rules defining when an action requires human approval.	Prod env + high-risk action → require approval
Business Impact Mapping	Service criticality and dependency chain info.	trading-core → high impact

3. Optional Contextual / Secondary Inputs
These can enhance prioritization and decision-making.

Input	Description	Example
IT Ops Alerts	Manual incident reports from NOC/IT.	Email, PagerDuty
Application Owner Feedback	Validation or override of remediation.	Approve/deny actions
Change Management Data	Planned maintenance windows.	No auto-remediation allowed during deploys
Historical Incident Records	Past resolution effectiveness.	ML model training data
