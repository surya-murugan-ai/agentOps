# AgentOps Test Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Critical Server Crisis
**Objective**: Test system response to critical server issues

### Setup Data:
- Redis cache server with 98.7% memory usage
- Database master with 89.7% CPU usage  
- Critical alerts triggered

### Expected Behavior:
1. Anomaly Detector identifies unusual resource patterns
2. Predictive Analytics forecasts potential system failure
3. Recommendation Engine suggests immediate remediation actions
4. Approval & Compliance routes high-confidence actions for auto-approval
5. Remediation Executor implements approved fixes
6. Audit & Reporting logs all actions for compliance

## Scenario 2: Network Performance Degradation
**Objective**: Test network monitoring and response capabilities

### Setup Data:
- API server showing 200% latency increase (8ms → 25.6ms)
- Load balancer health check failures
- Multiple affected endpoints

### Expected Behavior:
1. Real-time detection of network anomalies
2. Correlation of latency spikes with API endpoints
3. Automated traffic rerouting recommendations
4. Load balancer configuration updates
5. Performance improvement validation

## Scenario 3: Data Upload and Processing
**Objective**: Test comprehensive data ingestion capabilities

### Test Steps:
1. Upload JSON server data (8 servers)
2. Upload CSV metrics data (5 additional servers)
3. Upload JSON alerts data (8 critical alerts)
4. Verify data consistency and relationships
5. Validate agent processing of new data

## Scenario 4: Compliance and Audit Trail
**Objective**: Test regulatory compliance features for financial institutions

### Setup Data:
- High-risk remediation actions requiring approval
- Security-sensitive operations on production systems
- Multi-level approval workflows

### Expected Behavior:
1. All actions logged with timestamps and user attribution
2. Approval workflows enforce security policies
3. Audit reports generated for compliance officers
4. Risk scoring prevents unauthorized automated actions

## Scenario 5: Predictive Failure Prevention
**Objective**: Test proactive monitoring and prevention capabilities

### Setup Data:
- Trending disk usage growth (150MB/hour)
- SSL certificate expiring in 14 days
- Database replication lag increasing

### Expected Behavior:
1. Trend analysis identifies future capacity issues
2. Preventive maintenance recommendations generated
3. Automated certificate renewal processes triggered
4. Capacity planning alerts for infrastructure team

## Scenario 6: Real-time Dashboard Updates
**Objective**: Test WebSocket real-time capabilities

### Test Steps:
1. Monitor dashboard while agents process data
2. Verify real-time metric updates
3. Test alert notification delivery
4. Validate agent status changes
5. Confirm remediation action progress tracking

## Scenario 7: Multi-Environment Management
**Objective**: Test handling of diverse server environments

### Setup Data:
- Production servers (NYC Data Center, AWS)
- Staging environment servers
- Development environment servers
- Different criticality levels and SLA requirements

### Expected Behavior:
1. Environment-specific alerting thresholds
2. Production vs non-production handling differences
3. Appropriate escalation procedures
4. Resource allocation based on environment criticality

## Scenario 8: Load and Performance Testing
**Objective**: Test system performance under load

### Test Steps:
1. Upload large datasets (100+ servers, 1000+ metrics)
2. Trigger multiple simultaneous alerts
3. Process concurrent remediation actions
4. Measure response times and system stability
5. Validate data integrity under load

## Scenario 9: Error Recovery and Resilience
**Objective**: Test system recovery from various failure conditions

### Test Cases:
1. AI service timeout/failure simulation
2. Database connection interruption
3. WebSocket disconnection/reconnection
4. Invalid data format handling
5. Network partition scenarios

## Scenario 10: Integration Testing
**Objective**: Test end-to-end workflows across all system components

### Complete Workflow Test:
1. New server discovery → telemetry collection
2. Anomaly detection → alert generation  
3. Recommendation → approval → execution
4. Result validation → audit logging
5. Dashboard updates → user notification
